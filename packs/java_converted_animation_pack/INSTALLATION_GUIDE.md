# Installation Guide — Java → Bedrock Animation Pack

## Install as a folder
1. Copy `java_converted_animation_pack/` into:
   - `games/com.mojang/resource_packs/`
2. Open Minecraft → **Settings** → **Storage** and verify the pack appears.

## Install as a .mcpack
1. Zip the *contents* of `java_converted_animation_pack/` (the zip root must contain `manifest.json`).
2. Rename the zip to `Java_to_Bedrock_Animation_Pack.mcpack`.
3. Open the `.mcpack` to import.

## Enable & stack with other packs
You can enable this pack:
- by itself, or
- together with `iPad Air 5 Optimization Pack`.

When stacking multiple packs, remember:
- **Higher priority packs override lower priority packs** for any overlapping files.
- These two packs are structured to avoid overlap, so order should not matter.
