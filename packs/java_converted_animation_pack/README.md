# Java → Bedrock Animation Pack

## What this pack is
A **standalone Bedrock resource pack** that contains animation-related assets (animations + animation controller + client entity override) intended to be used on its own or stacked with other packs.

## What’s inside
- `animations/` – converted/ported animations
- `animation_controllers/` – a lightweight controller to switch between idle/walk/fly
- `entity/` – client entity override wiring the animations to `minecraft:player`

## Stacking
This pack is designed to stack alongside the optimization pack in this repo:
- `packs/ipad_air_5_optimization_pack/`

Because the optimization pack does **not** include animation/entity overrides, the two packs can be enabled together without file conflicts.

## Install
See `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`.
